Hey Mike,

In the DICOM patient coordinate system, the x axis increases to the
patient left, the y axis increases to patient posterior and the z axis
increases to patient superior.  The Image Position (Patient) tag in the
DICOM dose file gives you the xyz coordinates of the center of the first
pixel.  The Image Orientation (Patient) tag gives you the directional
cosines of the image axes with respect to that patient coordinate system.

If your patient is Head First Supine, you can generate xyz axes for your
pixel data like this (assuming I haven't botched the orientation):

image=dicom.read_file(filename)

rows = image.Rows
columns = image.Columns
pixel_spacing = image.PixelSpacing
image_position = image.ImagePositionPatient

x_axis = numpy.arange(columns)*pixel_spacing[0] + image_position[0]
y_axis = numpy.arange(rows)*pixel_spacing[1] + image_position[1]
z_axis = numpy.array(image.GridFrameOffsetVector) + image_position[2]

You can find a much better explanation of this in the Medical Image FAQ at

and a diagram in the presentation at
